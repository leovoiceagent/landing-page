# Meeting Recordings

Store meeting recordings and audio/video files here.

## Important Notice

Large audio and video files should NOT be committed directly to Git repositories.

## Recommended Approach

### Cloud Storage
Instead of storing files directly in Git:
1. Upload recordings to cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
2. Store links and metadata in this folder
3. Use consistent naming conventions

### File Naming Convention
```
YYYY-MM-DD-meeting-type-participants.extension

Examples:
2024-08-16-stakeholder-meeting-team-leads.mp4
2024-08-20-technical-review-dev-team.mp3
2024-08-25-investor-update-executives.mp4
```

### Recording Metadata Template

Create a markdown file for each recording with metadata:

```markdown
# Meeting Recording: [Date] - [Topic]

## Details
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Duration**: X minutes
- **Participants**: List of attendees
- **Meeting Type**: Stakeholder/Technical/Planning/etc.

## Recording Location
- **Cloud Storage Link**: [URL]
- **Access Level**: Team/Management/Board
- **Retention Period**: X months

## Key Topics Discussed

- [ ] Action item 2 (Assignee: @username)

```

### Privacy and Compliance

- Ensure consent for recording from all participants
- Follow company data retention policies
- Maintain appropriate access controls
- Consider auto-deletion after retention period
- Comply with GDPR and other privacy regulations

### Backup Strategy

- Primary storage: Company cloud platform
- Backup storage: Secondary cloud provider
- Local backup: For critical recordings only
- Archive old recordings according to policy
