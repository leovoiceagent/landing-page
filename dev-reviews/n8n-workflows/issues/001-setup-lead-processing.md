**Status:** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS  
**Assignee:** @backend-dev  
**Priority:** High  
**Created:** 2024-08-16  
**Updated:** 2024-08-16  

## Problem Description

Implement the core lead processing workflow in N8N that receives lead data from the Retell.AI voice agent, qualifies and scores leads, integrates with CRM systems, and triggers appropriate follow-up actions. This workflow is critical for converting voice interactions into actionable business opportunities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] N8N workflow receives webhook data from Retell.AI
- [ ] Lead qualification algorithm implemented with scoring logic
- [ ] CRM integration (Salesforce/HubSpot) creates/updates contact records
- [ ] Automated email confirmations sent to leads
- [ ] Hot leads trigger immediate notifications to sales team
- [ ] Lead nurture sequences initiated for lower-priority leads
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic implemented
- [ ] Workflow logging and monitoring configured
- [ ] Data validation and sanitization implemented
- [ ] Testing completed with various lead scenarios

## Technical Requirements

### Webhook Configuration
- Endpoint: `/webhook/lead-processing`
- Method: POST
- Authentication: API key validation
- Rate limiting: 100 requests/minute
- Timeout: 30 seconds

### Lead Scoring Algorithm

**Scoring Factors (100 points total):**
- Income qualification (30 points)
  - 3x rent ratio = 30 points
  - 2.5x rent ratio = 20 points
  - 2x rent ratio = 10 points
- Timeline urgency (25 points)
  - â‰¤30 days = 25 points
  - â‰¤60 days = 20 points
  - â‰¤90 days = 15 points
- Contact quality (20 points)
  - Phone + email = 20 points
  - Phone or email = 10 points
- Property specificity (15 points)
  - Specific property ID = 15 points
  - Property type specified = 10 points
- Rental history (10 points)
  - Currently renting = 10 points
  - Previous rental experience = 5 points

**Lead Quality Categories:**
- Hot: 80+ points (immediate follow-up)
- Warm: 60-79 points (same day follow-up)
- Medium: 40-59 points (next business day)
- Low: <40 points (email nurture sequence)

### Integration Requirements

#### CRM Integration
- **Primary**: Salesforce API
- **Secondary**: HubSpot API
- **Fallback**: CSV export to shared drive

#### Email Service
- **Primary**: SendGrid API
- **Secondary**: SMTP fallback
- **Templates**: HTML and text versions

#### Notification Systems
- **Slack**: Hot lead alerts
- **Email**: Sales team notifications
- **SMS**: Emergency escalation (Twilio)

## Workflow Structure

### Node Sequence
1. **Webhook Trigger** - Receive lead data
2. **Data Validation** - Sanitize and validate input
3. **Lead Qualification** - Calculate score and quality
4. **Quality Router** - Route based on lead score
5. **CRM Upsert** - Create/update contact record
6. **Email Confirmation** - Send confirmation to lead
7. **Sales Notification** - Alert sales team for hot leads
8. **Nurture Trigger** - Start nurture sequence for low-priority leads
9. **Success Logger** - Log successful processing
10. **Error Handler** - Handle failures and retries

### Data Flow

**Input Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "firstName": "string",
  "lastName": "string", 
  "email": "string",
  "phoneNumber": "string",
  "monthlyIncome": "number",
  "desiredRent": "number",
  "moveInDate": "date",
  "propertyType": "string",
  "propertyId": "string",
  "currentlyRenting": "boolean",
  "conversationSummary": "string",
  "callDuration": "number",
  "timestamp": "datetime"
}
```

**Output Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "leadId": "string",
  "leadScore": "number",
  "leadQuality": "string",
  "suggestedActions": ["array"],
  "crmContactId": "string",
  "emailSent": "boolean",
  "notificationsSent": ["array"],
  "processedAt": "datetime",
  "processingStatus": "string"
}
```

## Files to Create/Modify

### New Workflow Files
- `n8n-workflows/workflows/lead-processing.json` - Main workflow
- `n8n-workflows/workflows/lead-nurture-sequence.json` - Follow-up automation
- `n8n-workflows/templates/email-templates.json` - Email templates

### Configuration Files
- `n8n-workflows/config/crm-mapping.json` - Field mapping configurations
- `n8n-workflows/config/scoring-rules.json` - Lead scoring parameters
- `n8n-workflows/config/notification-settings.json` - Alert configurations

### Testing Files
- `n8n-workflows/test-data/sample-leads.json` - Test lead data
- `n8n-workflows/test-data/edge-cases.json` - Edge case scenarios

## Implementation Details

### Lead Qualification Function
```javascript
// Calculate lead score based on multiple factors
let score = 0;

// Income qualification logic
if (leadData.monthlyIncome && leadData.desiredRent) {
  const ratio = leadData.monthlyIncome / leadData.desiredRent;
  if (ratio >= 3) score += 30;
  else if (ratio >= 2.5) score += 20;
  else if (ratio >= 2) score += 10;
}

// Timeline urgency calculation
if (leadData.moveInDate) {
  const daysUntilMoveIn = calculateDays(leadData.moveInDate);
  if (daysUntilMoveIn <= 30) score += 25;
  else if (daysUntilMoveIn <= 60) score += 20;
  else if (daysUntilMoveIn <= 90) score += 15;
}

// Additional scoring logic...
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Retry Logic**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- **Fallback Options**: Alternative endpoints and methods
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Failed messages for manual review
- **Alerting**: Immediate notification for critical failures

### Monitoring and Logging
- **Success Metrics**: Processing time, success rate
- **Error Tracking**: Failed webhooks, integration errors
- **Performance Monitoring**: Queue depth, processing latency
- **Business Metrics**: Lead volume, quality distribution
